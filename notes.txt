how to make the cards
since each day is stored as an index of an array, make a for loop starting at index 1 and ending at index 5
make a container to put the stuff in
make an element for each piece of data I need to have in each card
attach data to el
attach those els to container
attach container to fiveDay container

data I need for cards
Date (find out how to add i to moment)
Icon (data.daily[i].weather[0].icon put into url for png)
Temp (data.daily[i].temp.day + deg f)
Wind (data.daily[i].wind_speed + mph)
